## Poetry

Since childhood, I have struggled with a quiet inability to express myself. Somewhere within that silence, I found writing not as performance, but as understanding. Writing became a way to make sense of what I felt and, often, what others might be feeling too.

Below are a few pieces shaped during important moments of my life.

### Losing Myself

<div class="poem">
This body doesn’t feel like mine anymore.  
The constant conflict  
of heart against brain.  

What they want, I can’t face.  
Their impositions twist my fears,  
and this burden  
shatters me into tears.  

Lost feelings.  
Lost goals.  
Living like a constant devil,  
I don’t empathize anymore.  

Content in their desires,  
I accepted my fate.  
Feeling so numb,  
Every heart seems fake.  

You dragged me into your world,  
and I confined my own.  

Kill all my wants,  
but let me breathe freely  
once more.
</div>

<div class="context">
This poem was written during a period of intense transition in my master’s, when much of my life felt like a continuous test of endurance. I was trying to meet expectations, to excel, to become someone the world would recognize. Over time, however, that sense of openness began to narrow. The more I tried to become what was expected of me, the more mechanical I felt. Decisions no longer felt like my own. The ease with which I once connected to people, to empathy, to small moments of warmth, started to fade.

*Losing Myself* emerged not as a lament, but as recognition. It was my way of naming what felt like it was slipping away, and quietly insisting on the possibility of returning to it.
