Since childhood, I’ve carried a quiet inability to speak my emotions aloud.  
But somewhere in that silence, I discovered writing, not only as a way to understand my own feelings, but as a way to step into others’.  

People often call me an empath, and perhaps they’re right.  
When I write, I don’t just express what I feel; I inhabit what *someone else* might be feeling.  
Their grief, their hesitation, their quiet hopes, they live through my words before I even realize it.  

Writing, for me, is both mirror and refuge.  
It’s how I translate emotion into something I can finally see.
Below, I share a few of my pieces — reflections that speak in the language I couldn’t always find.  
I’m always open to thoughts, reflections, and feedback on how they make you feel.

### Forgetting Myself  
<div class="poem">
This body doesn’t feel like mine anymore.  
The constant conflict  
of heart against brain.  

What they want, I can’t face.  
Their impositions twist my fears,  
and this burden  
shatters me into tears.  

Lost feelings.  
Lost goals.  
Living like a constant devil,  
I don’t empathize anymore.  

Content in their desires,  
I accepted my fate.  
Feeling so numb,  
every heart seems fake.  

You dragged me into your world,  
and I confined my own.  

Kill all my wants,  
but let me breathe freely  
once more.  
</div>

> *A quiet descent into losing the self to everything that isn’t you.*
### Story Behind *Forgetting Myself*

This poem was born during one of the heaviest periods of my life — sometime in my master’s, when everything around me felt like a test of endurance.  

I was trying to do everything I thought I was supposed to do — pushing myself to excel, to prove I belonged, to become someone the world would recognize.  
Research was new to me then, and at first, it felt beautiful — the curiosity, the creation, the sense of building something meaningful. But slowly, I began to feel like I was losing the part of myself that made me *feel*.  

The more I tried to become what others expected, the more mechanical I became. Every decision felt like it belonged to someone else.  
The warmth I used to find in small moments — empathy, connection, even compassion — started fading.  
People around me began to feel like machines, and so did I.  

That’s when I wrote *Forgetting Myself* — not to lament the loss, but to name it.  
It was my way of saying: I see what’s slipping away, and I want to find my way back to being human again.
