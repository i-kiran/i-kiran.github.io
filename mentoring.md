  <h4>Mentoring</h4>

  <p>
  I am always eager to collaborate with <strong>curious and self-motivated students</strong> who are excited about exploring open-ended questions in <strong>AI, Information Retrieval, and Responsible Machine Learning</strong>. I see mentorship as a space for shared growth — one that blends critical thinking, creativity, and care — and I actively welcome students who are eager to push boundaries, challenge assumptions, and learn by building.
  </p>

  <p>
  Over the past few years, I’ve been fortunate to work with and mentor several talented students across research projects, independent studies, and classroom collaborations. A few of them include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aditya Gupta</strong> (Issaquah High School) – Working on proactive agents and quantum computing.</li>
    <li><strong>Manya Chadha</strong> (University of Washington) – Worked on responsible adaptation of LLMs; now a <em>Data Scientist at Kaizen Analytics</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Rachel Chalissery</strong> (University of Washington) – Working on personalized agents. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Beyond one-on-one mentorship, I serve as a <strong>Pre-Doctoral Lecturer</strong> for 
  <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/courses/info/376" target="_blank">INFO 376: Intro to Search & Recommender Systems</a> at the University of Washington. 
  </p>

  If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out — I’m always open to new ideas and conversations that bridge curiosity with purpose.
