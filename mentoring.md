  <h4>Mentoring</h4>

  <p>
  I am always eager to collaborate with curious and self-motivated students who are excited about pushing the boundaries of personalization and proactivity.
  </p>

  <p>
  Over the past few years, I’ve been fortunate to work with and mentor several talented students across research projects, independent studies, and classroom collaborations. A few of them include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    
    <li><strong>Manya Chadha</strong> (University of Washington) – Worked on responsible adaptation of LLMs; now a <em>Data Scientist at Kaizen Analytics</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Rachel Chalissery</strong> (University of Washington) – Working on personalized agents. </li>
    <li><strong>Aditya Gupta</strong> (Issaquah High School) – Working on proactive agents and quantum computing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Beyond one-on-one research mentorship, I serve as a <strong>Pre-Doctoral Lecturer</strong> for 
  <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/kaur13" target="_blank">INFO 376: Intro to Search & Recommender Systems</a> at the University of Washington. I also support students who are interested in applying to grad school but have questions about where to start through <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program/phd-admissions/pams/"target="_blank">PAMS (Pre-Application Mentorship Service)</a>. 
  </p>

  <p>
  If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out. I’m always open to new ideas and conversations that bridge curiosity with purpose.
